# OpenBoltRF
## An open-source workflow to analyse load transfer for geometrically imperfect bolted ring-flanges in offshore wind turbines.

OpenBoltRF is an open-source workflow to analyse the load transfer for geometrically imperfect bolted ring-flanges in offshore wind turbine support structures. It is intended as a lightweight, portable package for users familiar with FreeCAD, Salome Meca / Code Aster, Paraview, and Python. 

# Pre-requisites
The use of OpenBoltRF assumes execution on a Linux-based system, with access to the following pre-requisites:-

  - Salome Meca 2021   or later
    - Singularity container installation, including Paravis
  - Python 3.8.5       or later


the following tools are pre-installed
